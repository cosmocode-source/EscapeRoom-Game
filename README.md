# Info on code details
The Vault of Echoes is a Windows-based, text-driven escape room adventure game written in C. It immerses players in a narrative puzzle experience across four uniquely designed rooms—Chamber of Light, Echo Library, Machine Core, and The Eye of Silence—each requiring logic, memory, and item collection to unlock the final escape code. The program utilizes several key libraries: stdio.h and string.h for basic I/O and string operations, windows.h for multi-threading and system controls, conio.h for real-time key input, and mmsystem.h with winmm.lib to manage dynamic background music using PlaySound. The main function initializes the game environment, manages difficulty selection, and starts the core loop. User input is processed through user_input(), which limits retries to three. The game flow is controlled by ask_puzzles(), which allows the player to navigate between rooms, manage inventory, and attempt escape. A background timer is implemented in TimerThread() and music changes in MusicThread() using multithreading and synchronization via pause_event. Each room—room1() to room4()—contains puzzles, hint systems (with difficulty-based conditions), and progression logic, rewarding correct answers with time bonuses and inventory items while tracking errors and applying penalties in hard mode. An inventory system is implemented through add_to_inventory(), has_inventory(), and show_inventory(), while achievements are tracked and displayed using the Achievements() function. Escape is granted by solving all rooms and entering the correct code (3694), verified inside ask_puzzles(). The game ends with a custom animatedCredits() function, featuring scrolling text and music, and a special effects sequence is included via simulate_blinding_light() using console attribute changes and sound. Throughout, the game maintains immersive narrative, real-time audio, and replayability via multiple difficulty levels, all within a modular, function-rich architecture.
# Info on how to procced with the gameplay
To play The Vault of Echoes, start by selecting your preferred difficulty mode: Easy (more time and free hints), Normal (standard), or Hard (less time, no hints, time penalties). After a short intro sequence, you’ll be placed in a central hub from where you can enter any of the four rooms—each representing a different type of puzzle and theme. Use the numbered menu to choose a room, explore its options, and solve puzzles by reading clues and inputting answers. Some puzzles reward you with digits of the escape code, while others give you key inventory items required to unlock future rooms. You can view your inventory anytime and pick up special objects like the Shard or Symbol Key that are essential for progression. Once you've gathered enough clues and items, use the “Try to escape” option from the main menu to input the 4-digit code. If correct, you escape the vault; if not, you can keep exploring until the timer runs out or you choose to exit. Be mindful—wrong answers may reduce your time, especially in Hard mode. You can pause the game, view your inventory, and replay up to three times. Achievements are unlocked based on performance, like solving rooms without hints. The game ends either by escape, time-out, or quitting voluntarily, followed by animated credits if you succeed.
# Credits
The Vault of Echoes was collaboratively conceptualized and designed by Arin Singh, Apeksha Ashok, Ashritha Hegde, and Aryan Nangarath through extensive group discussions on game structure, mechanics, and puzzle design. The main game interface—including the core logic, navigation system, inventory management, and multi-threaded timer/music systems—was primarily programmed and integrated by Arin ensuring a seamless and immersive player experience. Each room in the game was individually crafted and coded by Apeksha , Ashritha and Aryan allowing for unique puzzle styles and creative diversity. Every consists of unique puzzels with the option of hints. Each hint is different and the puzzels are made to engaging enough for the user to be not distracted by anything else.
